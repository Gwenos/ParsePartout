	In order to better adapt to society, an association has developed a web chat application that allows anyone to express and share their concerns and anguishes. Several thousand anonymous conversations have been gathered and form a new corpus of stories about human distress and social violence. We present a method of corpus analysis combining unsupervised learning and word embedding in order to bring out the themes of this particular collection. We compare this approach with a standard algorithm of the literature on a labeled corpus and obtain very good results. An interpretation of the obtained clusters collection confirms the interest of the method.

	<introduction>
	Since the nineties, social suffering has been a theme that has received much attention from public and associative action. Among the consequences, there is an explosion of listening places or socio-technical devices of communication whose objectives consist in moderating the various forms of suffering by the liberation of the speech for a therapeutic purpose [1] [2]. As part of the METICS project, a suicide prevention association developed an application of web chat to meet this need. The web chat is an area that allows anyone to express and share with a volunteer listener their concerns and anguishes. The main specificity of this device is its anonymous nature. Protected by a pseudonym, the writers are invited to discuss with a volunteer the problematic aspects of their existence. Several thousand anonymous conversations have been gathered and form a corpus of unpublished stories about human distress. The purpose of the METICS project is to make visible the ordinary forms of suffering usually removed from common spaces and to grasp both its modes of enunciation and digital support. In this study, we want to automatically identify the reason for coming on the web chat for each participant. Indeed, even if the association provided us with the theme of all the conversations (work, loneliness, violence, racism, addictions, family, etc.), the original reason has not been preserved. In what follows, we first review some of the related
